This folder is for workbooks to test the functions used in this project.


Tests are split into the following groupings (roughly)

file Handling and Import:

testFileHandler.ipnyb
testCesmLoad.ipnyb
testCvdpTime.ipnyb

calculating indeces:

testMarshallSamCalc.ipnyb
testSamCalc.ipnyb
testSstIndexCalcs.ipnyb


averaging for time periods of interest:
exampleMonthlyAv.ipnyb
testPeriodAverages.ipnyb

To-Do:

- calculating indeces against dummy data
- automating results and then making a script to run all tests?

In addition to CMIP6/CESM-LME data used for main analysis, this also accesses CVDP outputs (for validation purposes only).
